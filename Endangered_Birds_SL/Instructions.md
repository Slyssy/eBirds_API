* At least one dataset must be uncleaned. No datasets may come from Kaggle.
* You must use at least one API for data retrieval in your project.
* You will present your data cleaning process either by showing your code or by displaying a markdown file. Focus on unique data transformation problems you encounter, not a standard use of Pandas. 

## Plotting

* You must use one and only one of the following to create at least 2-3 plots from your clean datasets: Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Tableau. Try to visualize as much information as possible in fewer plots.
